## Introduction

If you have reached here, then i assume that you have atleast heard once about Deep Learning. But actually what is it? This is the point where we lose it. Time and again we hear about the groundbreaking researchs being done in this field, products being built by tech giants like Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon and many more. What does actually go under the hood of these awesome projects? <br>
The basic underline of Deep Learning is Neural Network, not just any Neural Network but **Deep Neural Network (DNN)**. It looks like this.

Looks frightening isn't it. But actually is not that complex to understand. Little amount of **linear algebra** and **calculus** coupled with knowledge of a programming language and we are good to go forward with it.

## Motivation

Big giants are competing and pushing the boundaries of technology everyday and Deeplearning being the hottest field for advancement has certainly caught eye of these blue chip companies.
